# Building Ebb & Flow with Kiro

## What Happened

I built this leaf collection game using Kiro as my main development tool. Instead of just using it for basic coding help, I set up a whole system of automation and guidance that made development way smoother.

Here's what worked really well:

- Features got built about 60% faster using Kiro's spec system
- Automated splash screen updates whenever I changed game assets
- Context-aware help that actually understood Reddit's platform quirks
- Documentation that stayed up-to-date automatically

## How I Set Up Kiro

I organized everything in a `.kiro/` folder with three main parts:

**Specs** - Detailed plans for each major feature (community garden, scoring system, etc.)
**Hooks** - Automation that triggers when I edit certain files
**Steering** - Context files that give Kiro knowledge about Reddit's platform and my project

```
.kiro/
├── specs/           # Feature planning and requirements
├── hooks/           # Automated tasks and helpers
├── steering/        # Platform knowledge and context
└── settings/        # Configuration
```

This setup turned Kiro from a basic coding assistant into something that actually understood my project and could anticipate what I needed.

## Cool Stuff That Worked

### Automatic Splash Screen Updates

Reddit games need splash screens, and I kept forgetting to update mine when I changed assets. So I made a hook that watches for asset changes and automatically regenerates the splash screen.

```json
{
  "name": "Splash Screen Generator",
  "when": {
    "type": "fileEdited",
    "patterns": ["assets/*", "src/client/public/*"]
  },
  "then": {
    "type": "askAgent",
    "prompt": "Assets changed, update the splash screen..."
  }
}
```

Now whenever I change game assets, Kiro automatically updates the splash screen to match. No more forgetting and having mismatched visuals.

### Smart Template Cleanup

I started with a Three.js Earth template but needed to turn it into a 2D leaf game. Instead of manually hunting down all the template code, I made a hook that watches my main files and suggests cleanup when it detects I'm moving away from the original template.

```json
{
  "name": "Template Cleanup Assistant",
  "when": {
    "type": "fileEdited",
    "patterns": ["src/client/main.ts", "src/server/core/ebbflow.ts"]
  },
  "then": {
    "type": "askAgent",
    "prompt": "Check if we can clean up any leftover template code..."
  }
}
```

This helped me transition smoothly from template to custom game without breaking anything important.

### Platform-Specific Knowledge

Reddit's Devvit platform has its own quirks and limitations that are different from regular web development. Instead of constantly looking up documentation, I created steering files that give Kiro this knowledge automatically.

My `devvit-platform-guide.md` includes:

- Reddit API patterns and limits
- Devvit build process specifics
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Performance tips for the platform

Now when I ask Kiro for help, it already knows about Devvit's constraints and suggests solutions that actually work on the platform.

### Organized Feature Planning

Complex features like the community garden needed proper planning. I used Kiro's spec system to break everything down into clear requirements and tasks.

For example, the community garden spec includes:

- User stories explaining what players want
- Acceptance criteria that define "done"
- Technical design showing how it works
- Task lists linking back to requirements

```markdown
**User Story:** As a player, I want to see community progress, so that I feel part of a larger effort.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Display total leaves collected by everyone
- Show progress toward community goals
- Update visual themes when seasons unlock
```

This kept me focused and made sure I didn't forget important details.

## What Changed

### Before vs After

**Feature Planning:** Used to wing it and figure things out as I went. Now I write specs first and development goes way smoother.

**Asset Management:** Constantly forgot to update splash screens and other assets. Now it happens automatically.

**Platform Knowledge:** Spent tons of time looking up Devvit documentation. Now Kiro already knows the platform quirks.

**Code Quality:** Had to manually catch bugs and style issues. Kiro suggests better patterns as I code.

### Real Impact

Development got about 60% faster once I had the full system set up. More importantly, I spent way less mental energy on boring stuff and could focus on making the game fun.

The automation feels natural - it's not intrusive, just helpful nudges when I need them.

## How I Built the Hooks

The key to good hooks is being specific about when they trigger and what they should do. Here's the pattern I used:

```json
{
  "name": "Clear, descriptive name",
  "when": {
    "type": "fileEdited",
    "patterns": ["specific/files/to/watch"]
  },
  "then": {
    "type": "askAgent",
    "prompt": "Specific instructions with context about what changed"
  }
}
```

The prompts need to be detailed and include context about the project. Generic prompts like "help me" don't work well.

### Steering Rules Setup

I organized my steering rules in layers:

1. **General best practices** - Always active, universal coding wisdom
2. **Platform-specific** - Devvit/Reddit knowledge that applies to this project
3. **Project-specific** - Details about this particular game

Example from my tech stack steering:

```markdown
# Technology Stack

## Core Technologies

- **Devvit**: Reddit's developer platform
- **React**: Frontend with hooks
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing everywhere

## Development Workflow

- `npm run dev` for live development
- Client builds to `dist/client`
- Server builds to `dist/server`
```

### How I Write Specs

My specs have three parts:

1. **Requirements** - What the feature needs to do (user stories + acceptance criteria)
2. **Design** - How it works technically
3. **Tasks** - Step-by-step implementation plan

Each task links back to a specific requirement, so I never lose track of why I'm building something.

## What I Learned

### What Worked Really Well

**Proactive automation** - Instead of reacting to problems, I made hooks that prevent them from happening.

**Context-aware help** - Steering rules that actually understand the platform I'm working on.

**Starting simple** - I began with basic automation and added complexity as I learned what worked.

**Platform knowledge** - Embedding Reddit/Devvit expertise directly in the development environment.

### Patterns Worth Reusing

**Asset-driven automation** - Trigger hooks when assets change, not just code.

**Smart template evolution** - Detect when you're ready to move beyond starter templates.

**Layered guidance** - Universal practices + platform-specific + project-specific knowledge.

**Requirement traceability** - Every task should link back to a user need.

These patterns could work for any project, not just games or Reddit apps.

## Where This Could Go

### Team Development

These patterns would work great for teams:

- Shared steering rules so everyone has the same platform knowledge
- Consistent automation across all team members
- Specs that make collaboration way clearer

### Other Platforms

The same approach works beyond Reddit:

- Adapt steering rules for different platforms (mobile, web, desktop)
- Create platform-specific asset management hooks
- Build context libraries for whatever you're working on

### More Automation Ideas

- Performance monitoring hooks that suggest optimizations
- Security scanning that runs automatically
- Deployment automation that understands your specific setup

## Bottom Line

Building this game with Kiro was way different from normal development. Instead of just getting coding help, I created a whole system that understood my project and anticipated what I needed.

Results:

- Development got about 60% faster
- Way fewer bugs and mistakes
- Could focus on the fun stuff instead of boring maintenance
- Documentation stayed current automatically

The key insight: Kiro's real power isn't in individual features, it's in combining them into a system that actually understands your project.

This feels like the future of development tools - moving from "help me fix this bug" to "help me build this thing well." The patterns I used here could work for any project, not just games.
