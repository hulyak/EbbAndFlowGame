# Design Document

## Overview

The Community Garden System creates a persistent, shared virtual environment where individual player actions aggregate into collective achievements. The system uses Redis for real-time data synchronization and implements time-based goal generation with seasonal progression mechanics.

### Data Flow

```
Player Action → Contribution Aggregator → Goal Progress Tracker → Community Garden State
     ↓                                           ↓
Individual Stats ←→ Redis Persistence ←→ Seasonal Progression Engine
     ↓                                           ↓
UI Updates ←← Real-time Synchronizer ←← Content Unlocker
```

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Community Garden Core

**Purpose:** Central coordinator managing community state and progression
**Key Methods:**

- `getCommunityGarden(): Promise<CommunityGarden>`
- `updateCommunityGoals(contribution: number, username: string): Promise<GoalProgress[]>`
- `generateDailyGoals(): Promise<CommunityGoal[]>`
- `advanceSeason(): Promise<SeasonChange>`

### 2. Goal Management System

**Purpose:** Handles creation, tracking, and completion of community objectives
**Goal Types:**

```typescript
interface CommunityGoal {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  targetLeaves: number;
  currentLeaves: number;
  reward: string;
  startTime: number;
  endTime: number;
  status: 'active' | 'completed' | 'expired';
  participants: number;
  type: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'special';
}
```

### 3. Seasonal Progression System

**Purpose:** Manages long-term community advancement and content unlocking
**Season Configuration:**

```typescript
interface SeasonConfig {
  spring: { theme: 'growth'; colors: ['pink', 'green']; unlockThreshold: 10000 };
  summer: { theme: 'abundance'; colors: ['yellow', 'orange']; unlockThreshold: 25000 };
  autumn: { theme: 'harvest'; colors: ['orange', 'red']; unlockThreshold: 50000 };
  winter: { theme: 'reflection'; colors: ['blue', 'white']; unlockThreshold: 100000 };
}
```

### 4. Contribution Tracking System

**Purpose:** Monitors individual and collective progress toward goals
**Tracking Metrics:**

```typescript
interface ContributionMetrics {
  individualTotal: number;
  dailyContribution: number;
  weeklyContribution: number;
  goalParticipation: string[];
  achievementLevel: number;
  lastContributionTime: number;
}
```

### 5. Real-time Synchronization

**Purpose:** Ensures consistent state across all connected players
**Synchronization Strategy:**

- Optimistic updates for immediate feedback
- Periodic state reconciliation
- Conflict resolution for concurrent modifications
- Graceful degradation for network issues

## Data Models

### Community Garden State

```typescript
interface CommunityGarden {
  totalLeavesCollected: number;
  activeGoals: CommunityGoal[];
  completedGoals: number;
  currentSeason: 'spring' | 'summer' | 'autumn' | 'winter';
  seasonProgress: number; // 0-100 percentage
  nextSeasonUnlock: number;
  gardenLevel: number;
  specialEvents: string[];
}
```

### Goal Progress Tracking

```typescript
interface GoalProgress {
  goalId: string;
  progress: number; // 0-100 percentage
  completed: boolean;
  participantCount: number;
  timeRemaining: number;
  recentContributors: string[];
}
```

### Seasonal Progression

```typescript
interface SeasonalState {
  currentSeason: Season;
  progressToNext: number;
  unlockedContent: string[];
  seasonalBonuses: SeasonalBonus[];
  themeConfiguration: ThemeConfig;
}
```

## Error Handling

### Concurrency Management

- Implement atomic operations for goal updates
- Use Redis transactions for consistent state changes
- Handle race conditions in contribution counting
- Provide rollback mechanisms for failed operations

### Network Resilience

- Cache community state locally for offline viewing
- Implement retry logic for failed synchronization
- Graceful degradation when real-time updates fail
- Queue contributions for later synchronization

### Data Consistency

- Validate goal progress calculations
- Implement checksums for critical community data
- Provide data recovery mechanisms
- Monitor for anomalous contribution patterns

## Testing Strategy

### Integration Testing

- Multi-player contribution scenarios
- Goal completion edge cases
- Seasonal transition accuracy
- Real-time synchronization reliability

### Performance Testing

- Concurrent user load testing
- Redis performance under high contribution rates
- Goal calculation efficiency
- Memory usage during peak activity

### Data Integrity Testing

- Contribution counting accuracy
- Goal state consistency across players
- Seasonal progression correctness
- Recovery from data corruption scenarios

## Implementation Considerations

### Scalability Design

- Horizontal scaling for contribution processing
- Efficient Redis key structures for fast lookups
- Batch processing for goal updates
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data

### Real-time Features

- WebSocket integration for live updates
- Efficient delta synchronization
- Optimistic UI updates with server reconciliation
- Bandwidth optimization for mobile users

### Community Engagement

- Dynamic goal difficulty based on participation
- Recognition systems for top contributors
- Social features for goal coordination
- Gamification elements to encourage participation

### Seasonal Content Management

- Flexible content configuration system
- A/B testing for seasonal themes
- Community voting on future content
- Analytics tracking for engagement patterns
