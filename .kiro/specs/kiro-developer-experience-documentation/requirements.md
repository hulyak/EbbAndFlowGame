# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating comprehensive documentation that demonstrates how Kiro's capabilities were leveraged throughout the development of the Ebb & Flow Reddit game project. The documentation will showcase creative integration of Kiro's specs, hooks, and steering features to enhance developer productivity and code quality.

## Glossary

- **Kiro**: AI-powered IDE and development assistant
- **Devvit**: Reddit's developer platform for building interactive applications
- **Specs**: Kiro's structured approach to feature development with requirements, design, and task management
- **Hooks**: Automated triggers that execute agent actions based on file changes or user interactions
- **Steering**: Context-aware guidance system that provides project-specific instructions and best practices
- **Developer Experience (DX)**: The overall experience developers have when working with tools, frameworks, and workflows
